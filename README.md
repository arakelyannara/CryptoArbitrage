## CryptoArbitrage

This is a repo that prepares and analyzes the 3-month-long data of Bitcoin trade and finds the arbitrage opportunities in two exchanges.
The code import the data from bitstamp.csv and coinbase.csv. 
The column names in the file are 
"Timestamp", "Open", "High", "Low", "Close", "BTC Volume", "UDS Volume", "Weighted Price".
In my analysis I used the closing price for each record. 
Analysis has been done for data from Jan.1, 2018 to March 31, 2018.
